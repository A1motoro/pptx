# The 48-Hour Rebellion (Finding Agency In the Age of Algorithms)
## Slide 1: Intro
Good morning! Today I'm gonna share my reaction of the TED talk given by Bryce Dallas Howard, which finnaly will lead to the 48-h rebellion.

## Slide 2: Talker Introduction
So, let's first take a look at the talk giver - Bryce. Bryce is an actress and also a director, also the star of Black Mirror's "Nosedive". More importantly, she is in a family of 3-generation in the entertanmaint industry - which makes her family 70 years in the very spotlight. Having navigated public life for decades, her family has be into this "Privacy as a problem" era earlier than any other families.

So, why should we listen to her? It's because she isn't guessing. She shared her mom's method against a privacy-threatening era. The blueprint she share is from her real life.

## Slide 3: The Context
In the TED talk, Bryce introduced the "Global Social Experiment" in the "Nosedive", which is the first episode of Black Mirror Season 3.

 In the episode, the world is governed by social ratings. Everything someone do will reflect on his or her social rating. High rating groups can get bonus and priviledge when seeking social service like transportation or hotel booking. Crazy, right? Bryce said that we ain't there yet, but close. We have already enter the NEW ERA.

The problem of our world now is (1.)(2.)(3.).

We are making life-altering decisions about our boundaries with no precedent. The episode is some kind a prediction of future - we dont want that.

## Slide 4: The Trap
So, why do we feel anxious in our world? The situition of the real world is not like that in the episode. We are fighting against the algorithms of these social systems!   
Engineers verified the urge of human to be validated, you know, we all want instant connection. They then designed the algorithm to let us get feedback instantly after sharing something. We feel valued through this process, but lets think about this deeply: what about the raw unfiltered emotions in our instant reaction?  
We are trading our private moments for public metrics.

## Slide 5: The Evidence
Let's see if this is you!  
first you see something crazy, which we call it a trigger. A strong sense of emotion generates inside you. AH, why could he so evil! How come this happens?! Something like that.  
Then you react instantly. You shared it on X, or facebook, weibo or simply just your "moments", you know, in wechat.  
Tadang - you may find yourself lying on the bed regretting, or you may end up in aggressive comments. But it was all too late.  
The thing is that , balabala.

## Slide 6: The Solution.
We need a way out, which is the so-called "Cheryl Method". Bryce would call it "The 2-Day Delay", or, "the 48-h rebellion" alternatively. The rule is simpled but useful: Always wait 48 hours before posting anything.  
Before, you experience, and you exhibit. Now we need a "Magic PAUSE".It can turn the reaction into reflection.

## Slide 7： Why It Works?
Now we think about how a simple rule defeats the Complex System of social medium.  
Social media wants your immediate reaction, the impulse! Generally because we want validation, we follow it. But here comes the 48-h rule. It is a buffer, a Autonom
